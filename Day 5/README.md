## Task 1 (Java End-of-File)

"In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." â€” (Wikipedia: End-of-file)

The challenge here is to read n lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all n lines of content.

Hint: Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

- Input Format

Read some unknown  lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

- Output Format

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

- Sample Input

``` 
Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.
``` 

- Sample Output

``` 
1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.
``` 

## Task 2(Java Int to String)

You are given an integer , you have to convert it into a string.

Please complete the partially completed code in the editor. If your code successfully converts  into a string  the code will print "Good job". Otherwise it will print "Wrong answer".

n can range between -100 to 100 inclusive.

- Sample Input 0

100

- Sample Output 0

Good job
